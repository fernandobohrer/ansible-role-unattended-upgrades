# unattended_upgrade_origins defines the origins from which packages are upgraded.
#
# For Debian, this populates the 'Unattended-Upgrade::Origins-Pattern' entry:
#
# Unattended-Upgrade::Origins-Pattern
# Automatically upgrade packages from these origin patterns. Examples:
# "o=Debian,a=stable", "o=Debian,a=stable-updates", "o=Debian,a=stable-backports"
# If left unset, the value associated to the variable below will be used instead:
# __unattended_upgrade_origins_pattern
#
# For Ubuntu, this populates the 'Unattended-Upgrade::Allowed-Origins' entry:
#
# Unattended-Upgrade::Allowed-Origins
# Automatically upgrade packages from these (origin:archive) pairs. Examples:
# "${distro_id}:${distro_codename}", "${distro_id}:${distro_codename}-security"
# If left unset, the value associated to the variable below will be used instead:
# __unattended_upgrade_allowed_origins
#
# unattended_upgrade_origins: []

# Unattended-Upgrade::Package-Blacklist
# No packages that match the regular expressions in this list will be marked for upgrade. If a package A has a
# blacklisted package B as a dependency then both packages A and B will not be upgraded. Note that it's a list
# of regular expressions, so you may need to escape special characters like "+" as "\+".
unattended_upgrade_package_blacklist: []
# Unattended-Upgrade::Package-Whitelist
# Only packages that match the regular expressions in this list will be marked for upgrade. By default dependencies
# of whitelisted packages are allowed. This can be changed to only ever allow whitelisted packages with the
# Unattended-Upgrade::Package-Whitelist-Strict boolean option. Unattended-Upgrade::Package-Blacklist still applies,
# thus blacklisted packages covered by the whitelist will still not be upraded nor will be installed or upgraded as
# dependencies of whitelisted packages.

# Ubuntu specific
# Unattended-Upgrade::DevRelease
# This option controls whether the development release of Ubuntu will be upgraded automatically.

# Acquire::http::Dl-Limit
# Use the APT bandwidth limit feature.

# Dpkg::Options
# Set dpkg options that take effect during unattended upgrades. Configuration file changes can block installation
# of certain packages. Passing the flags "--force-confdef" and "--force-confold" will ensure updates are applied
# and old configuration files are preserved.
# Example:
# dpkg_options:
#   - "--force-confdef"
#   - "--force-confold"
dpkg_options: false

# Unattended-Upgrade::Allow-APT-Mark-Fallback
# When APT fails to mark a package to be upgraded or installed try adjusting candidates of related packages to help
# APT's resolver in finding a solution where the package can be upgraded or installed. This is a workaround until
# APT's resolver is fixed to always find a solution if it exists. (See Debian bug #711128). The fallback is enabled by
# default, except on Debian's sid release because uninstallable packages are frequent there. Disabling the fallback
# speeds up unattended-upgrades when there are uninstallable packages at the expense of rarely keeping back packages
# which could be upgraded or installed.

# Unattended-Upgrade::Allow-downgrade
# Allow package downgrade if Pin-Priority exceeds 1000.
